A to-do list is a tool used to organize and keep track of tasks or activities that need to be completed. It helps manage time, prioritize responsibilities, and improve productivity.

Prioritization: Tasks can be ranked by urgency or importance (e.g., high, medium, low).

Deadlines: Some tasks may have due dates or time limits.

Status Tracking: Tasks can be marked as "not started," "in progress," or "completed."

Categories: Tasks can be grouped into categories (e.g., work, personal, errands).

Reminders: Some lists include alerts or notifications to prompt action.

Notes: Additional details or subtasks can be added under each item.

Formats:

Paper-based: Notebook, planner, sticky notes.

Digital: Apps like Todoist, Microsoft To Do, Google Tasks, or built-in phone reminders.
